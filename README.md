---------
<br/>

### Confrence
> Multiple tracks
>> Sessions(morning & afternoon)
>>> Multiple talks in each session

<br/>


### Time
- Time in minutes
- lightning means 5 mins

<br/>

## Improvement and Optimization
- simple algo is done, however improvement and optimization can be done
- we can short by sessionTime in desc order to for ease of query, and remove the one which are added
- we can also start filling Afternoon Sessions first & morning sessions later, so it has filled up for 4 to 5hours bufore netwrking event, assuming we can have empty morning sesssions
- we can use 2D filling algos for optimization
